# rust_http_server

The final project of the rust book. Making an HTTP server using rust. There are
three stages to the project:

1. Single threaded http server
2. Multithreaded http server
3. Graceful shutdown and cleanup.

## Learning goals

Learn how a project is organized in rust, along with some concepts from
networking, such as TCP and HTTP protocols. Also write some concurrent code in
Rust to understand the benefit of memory and type safety in Rust.

## Progress

- [x] Single threaded http server
- [ ] Multithreaded component
- [ ] Graceful shutdown and cleanup
